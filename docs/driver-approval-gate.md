# Driver approval gate map

Inventory of every path that offers a trip to a driver, matches or assigns a driver, notifies a driver about a trip, or lets a driver accept. This document does not change behavior.

**Rule intended by product:** only a driver with `driver_applications.onboarding_status = 'approved'` may receive or accept rides. Admins (`public.is_admin()` in SQL; `loadStaffAccess` in `server/staffAccess.js`) are the only planned exception.

**Shared predicate today:** `canReceiveRides(status)` in `shared/driverOnboarding.js` is `status === 'approved'`. It does not treat admin/staff as approved. `server/driverApproval.js` re-exports it and wraps the DB lookup as `driverApprovalStatus(sb, profileId)`. As of t2, `driverApprovalStatus` and `receivableDriverIds` also allow a profile when `loadStaffAccess` says they are admin or support. `receivableDriverIds` reads `driver_applications` once for the whole candidate list.

**Statuses** (`shared/driverOnboarding.js` `ONBOARDING_STATUSES`): `pending_info`, `pending_docs`, `pending_review` (UI: under review), `approved`, `rejected`. Missing application row is treated as not approved.

## How to read the table

| Checks approval today? | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| yes | This path itself reads `onboarding_status` / `canReceiveRides` / `driver_is_approved` / `list_approved_driver_ids` before offering, assigning, notifying, or accepting. |
| no | This path does not read approval. An unapproved driver can reach it if they already have a `driver_status` row, `profiles.role = driver`, or a leftover `online = true`. |
| sql-only | JavaScript does not check. A Postgres trigger/function in `supabase/driver_onboarding_approval.sql` would, **if that file is applied**. It is not a dated file under `supabase/migrations/`. |
| n/a | Does not assign or offer to a driver. |

Admin exception: **not implemented** on `canReceiveRides` or `public.driver_is_approved(uid)`. As of t2, `driverApprovalStatus` and `receivableDriverIds` do allow admin/staff via `loadStaffAccess`. An admin without `onboarding_status = 'approved'` is still not approved by the SQL helper.

## Inventory

| # | Path | Kind | Checks approval today? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `packages/rides-native/drivers.js` `fetchOnlineDrivers` | offer (rider picker) | yes | Filters `driver_status.online = true` through RPC `list_approved_driver_ids`, then one `driver_applications` read drops any id whose `onboarding_status` is not `approved`. Unapproved ids never become `visibleIds`. |
| 2 | `packages/rides-native/drivers.js` `fetchDriversByIds` | offer (saved drivers) | yes | Same RPC plus the same application-row drop. Unapproved favorites are omitted. |
| 3 | `src/lib/supabase.js` `fetchOnlineDrivers` | offer | yes | Delegates to (1). |
| 4 | `packages/rides-native/drivers.js` `setDriverOnline` | presence (enables claims) | yes | Going online requires `onboarding_status === 'approved'`. Going offline skips the gate. |
| 5 | `src/lib/supabase.js` `setDriverOnline` | presence | yes | Same check; web copy differs (`Admin approval is required…`). |
| 6 | `packages/rides-native/driverDesk.js` `acceptTrip` | accept | yes | Reads `driver_applications.onboarding_status`. Synthetic ids are rejected with the same copy. No admin bypass. |
| 7 | `apps/driver/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` `onAccept` / `toggle` | offer UI + accept + presence | yes | Real offers only when `status === 'approved'`. Pending review sees `syntheticOffers()` only. Accept and Go Online both refuse if not approved. |
| 8 | `src/screens/DriverHome.jsx` offer load / `acceptOffer` | offer UI + accept | yes | Open-pool query and Realtime subscribe run only when approved. Unapproved with no live trip renders `DriverApprovalGate`. |
| 9 | `server/friendRideRoutes.js` `handleFriendRideCreate` | match (student-driver carpool) | yes | `kind === 'carpool'` calls `driverApprovalStatus`. Friends-only creates skip this gate. |
| 10 | `server/friendRideLib.js` `maybeBookFriendRide` | match / assign | yes | If a driver is assigned at book time, `driverApprovalStatus` must be approved or the book returns `driver_not_approved`. Marketplace carpools with no `driver_profile_id` skip the check and insert `status: searching`. |
| 11 | SQL `public.driver_is_approved(uid)` | helper | yes | `onboarding_status = 'approved'` only. Defined in `supabase/driver_onboarding_approval.sql`. No `is_admin()` or. |
| 12 | SQL `public.list_approved_driver_ids(ids)` | helper | yes | Same file. Used by (1)(2). |
| 13 | SQL `enforce_driver_online_approval` / trigger `driver_status_require_approval` | presence | sql-only | Blocks `driver_status.online = true` unless `driver_is_approved`. Does not flip an existing `online = true` row when onboarding later changes. |
| 14 | SQL `enforce_trip_approved_driver` / trigger `trips_require_approved_driver` | accept / assign | sql-only | On insert (non-canceled with `driver_id`) or on assign / searching\|offered → accepted. No admin bypass. Not in `supabase/migrations/`. |
| 15 | `packages/rides-native/driverDesk.js` `loadDriverDesk` | offer | yes | Open-pool and unassigned scheduled rows are omitted unless `onboarding_status` is `approved`. The result includes `approvalGate` (the existing approval-gate copy). Already-accepted live trips still load. No admin bypass on this client query. |
| 16 | `apps/driver/app/queue.tsx` | offer UI + notify-adjacent | no (list) / yes (accept) | Always calls `loadDriverDesk`. Pending review **merges real desk offers with synthetic cards**. Accept goes through `acceptTrip` (6). |
| 17 | `apps/driver/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` `notifyNewRequest` effect | notify | no | Fires on `desk.offers` for approved **and** `pending_review` (desk is loaded for both). Filters out synthetic ids, so a pending-review driver can get a local Expo ping for a real open-pool row. |
| 18 | `src/screens/DriverHome.jsx` `loadScheduled` / toasts | offer + notify | no | Runs whenever `driverId` is set, including before / behind the approval gate. New scheduled rows toast `New scheduled ride`. Accept UI is behind the gate unless an `activeTrip` already exists. |
| 19 | `src/screens/DriverHome.jsx` `acceptScheduled` | accept | no | Calls `acceptScheduledTrip` RPC with no `onboarding_status` check. Relies on (8) hiding the queue, or on (21) once that migration is applied. |
| 20 | `src/lib/scheduledRides.js` `listOpenScheduledTrips` / `acceptScheduledTrip` | offer + accept | no | List uses RLS (22). Accept is `rpc('accept_scheduled_trip')` only. The RPC body in (21) is the approval gate after John applies it. |
| 21 | SQL `accept_scheduled_trip(p_trip_id)` | accept | no (file written, not applied) | Live body is still `supabase/migrations/20260924233000_block_unpaid_airport_deposit_accept.sql`: role `driver` or `admin`, plus the unpaid-deposit check. `supabase/migrations/20260925120001_driver_approval_accept_gate.sql` replaces the function and calls `assert_driver_may_accept` after that deposit check. NOT APPLIED. |
| 22 | SQL `trips_driver_scheduled_select` | offer (RLS) | no | Open scheduled rows are visible to `is_driver_or_admin_role()` (`profiles.role` driver or admin). Approval is not in the policy. Latest: `supabase/migrations/20260925015500_fix_profiles_trips_rls_recursion.sql`. |
| 23 | SQL `trips_online_driver_claim` | accept (RLS) | no | UPDATE of `searching`/`offered` with null `driver_id` allowed when `driver_status.online = true`. No `onboarding_status` clause. `supabase/driver_alerts_queue_tips.sql`. |
| 24 | SQL `trip_update_is_accept` / `block_unpaid_airport_deposit_accept` | accept (trigger) | no (approval file written, not applied) | Deposit trigger is unchanged and still applied. `trips_block_unapproved_driver_accept` in `supabase/migrations/20260925120001_driver_approval_accept_gate.sql` calls `assert_driver_may_accept` on the same accept predicate. NOT APPLIED. Until then a direct UPDATE can still claim. |
| 25 | `src/lib/driverOffers.js` `claimTrip` | accept | no | Direct `trips.update` to accepted. No application lookup. Not referenced by current screens (dead client helper). Would hit (24) after that migration is applied. |
| 26 | `server/endpoints/requestDriverTrip.js` | match / assign | yes | `receivableDriverIds` before insert. Unapproved preferred drivers return `driver_not_approved`. Staff/admin still assign. |
| 27 | `server/endpoints/scheduleTrip.js` | match | n/a | Inserts `scheduled` or `searching` with `driver_id` null. Later claimed via open pool / scheduled RPC. |
| 28 | `server/endpoints/tripOfferPreview.js` | offer preview | yes | Open `searching`/`offered` (and any not-yet-accepted assignment) requires `receivableDriverIds`. Response is the approval-gate copy with `driver_not_approved`. A trip already `accepted` / `arriving` / `arrived` / `in_progress` / `completed` for this driver still previews. |
| 29 | `src/lib/driverOffers.js` `fetchOfferPreview` | offer preview | no | Calls `/api/driver?action=offer-preview` (28). |
| 30 | `server/carpoolService.js` `matchRider` / `handleCarpoolMatch` | match (riders) | n/a | Rider-to-rider marketplace. No driver assigned. Booked trip is `searching` for the open pool. |
| 31 | `server/carpoolService.js` `createGroupRide` (`driving: true`) | match | yes | `receivableDriverIds` before insert. Unapproved drivers get `driver_not_approved` and no `driver_profile_id`. Marketplace creates (`driving: false`) still assign no driver. |
| 32 | `packages/rides-native/driverDesk.js` `publishDriverLocation` | presence | no | Upserts `driver_status.online` (default true). No application lookup. SQL (13) would reject unapproved online if applied. |
| 33 | `src/lib/driverTrack.js` `publishDriverLocation` | presence | no | Same as (32) for web. |
| 34 | `apps/driver/app/trip.tsx` location watch | presence | no | Calls (32) with `online: true` while a live trip is open, even if onboarding later flipped. |
| 35 | `packages/rides-native/driverDesk.js` `setPriorityMode` | presence | no | Upserts `driver_status` without touching approval. Leaves a pre-existing `online = true` in place. |
| 36 | `apps/driver/lib/push.ts` `registerDriverPush` | notify setup | no | Upserts `driver_status.expo_push_token` or `driver_push_tokens`. No approval check. **No server Expo fan-out exists** in this repo. |
| 37 | `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/driver.tsx` | notify | no | Polls `trips` in `searching`/`offered` and plays `alertNewRide`. No application lookup. |
| 38 | `packages/rides-native/syntheticOffers.js` | offer (demo) | n/a | Cards with `isSynthetic: true` for pending-review UI. `acceptTrip` refuses them. Not dispatch. |
| 39 | `packages/rides-native/tripTags.js` | copy | n/a | Labels, `acceptNeedsDriverOnline`, unpaid-deposit copy. Does not gate approval. |
| 40 | SQL `review_driver_application` | admin | partial | Reject sets `driver_status.online = false`. Approve does not require the driver to be admin. Does not by itself prevent a later client upsert from turning online back on except via (13). |

## Presence leak (why offers still reach unapproved drivers)

Going online is gated in the native/web helpers (4)(5) and, if applied, in SQL (13). That is not enough:

1. A `driver_status` row with `online = true` can be written **before** the application exists, or survive a later `pending_review` / `rejected` change. Reject handling (40) turns online off; other status writes do not.
2. `publishDriverLocation` (32)(33)(34) upserts `online: true` with no JS approval check.
3. Open-pool claim RLS (23) keys off `driver_status.online`, not `onboarding_status`.
4. Native open-pool load (15) now drops those rows for an unapproved driver, so the queue (16) no longer merges real open-pool cards during `pending_review`. Web scheduled list (18) and scheduled-select RLS (22) still do not re-check approval.
5. Preferred-driver assign (26) now re-checks approval on the server, including staff.
6. Accept UPDATE and `accept_scheduled_trip` stay open until John applies `supabase/migrations/20260925120001_driver_approval_accept_gate.sql`. That file is in the repo and is not applied.

`loadDriverDesk` still returns an already-accepted trip. The native home still subscribes to `trips` Realtime for `pending_review`, but `desk.offers` is empty unless the driver is approved, so (17) no longer pings a real open-pool row.

## SQL vs JS

| Mechanism | File | Applied as dated migration? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `driver_is_approved`, `list_approved_driver_ids`, `enforce_driver_online_approval`, `enforce_trip_approved_driver`, `review_driver_application` | `supabase/driver_onboarding_approval.sql` | no |
| Function bodies only (no `CREATE TRIGGER`) | `supabase/driver_pending_approval.sql` | no |
| `accept_scheduled_trip` + unpaid-deposit accept trigger | `supabase/migrations/20260924233000_block_unpaid_airport_deposit_accept.sql` | yes |
| `assert_driver_may_accept`, `trips_block_unapproved_driver_accept`, replaced `accept_scheduled_trip` (deposit check kept) | `supabase/migrations/20260925120001_driver_approval_accept_gate.sql` | no — written, NOT APPLIED. No version prefix clash after renaming to 20260925120001. |
| `trips_driver_scheduled_select` | `supabase/migrations/20260925015500_fix_profiles_trips_rls_recursion.sql` | yes |
| `trips_online_driver_claim` | `supabase/driver_alerts_queue_tips.sql` | no dated migration in this tree |

Client `fetchOnlineDrivers` already depends on `list_approved_driver_ids`. If that RPC is missing, the picker errors rather than showing unapproved drivers.

---

## Admin exception (intended, not wired)

- SQL: `public.is_admin()` (`supabase/driver_onboarding_approval.sql`, replaced in `supabase/migrations/20260924190000_admin_support.sql`).
- Server staff: `loadStaffAccess` in `server/staffAccess.js` (`isAdminIdentity` + `admin_users.access_role`).
- `accept_scheduled_trip` on the live database allows `profiles.role = 'admin'` without onboarding, which is a role check, not `is_admin()`. The unapplied t3 migration adds `public.is_admin()` as the accept exception (`assert_driver_may_accept`).
- `canReceiveRides` / `driver_is_approved` do **not** or-in admin. `driverApprovalStatus` and `receivableDriverIds` do, via `loadStaffAccess`.

---

## Tests for this map

`server/driverApproval.test.js` pins `canReceiveRides` for every `ONBOARDING_STATUSES` value plus `null` / `undefined` / garbage, and `driverApprovalStatus` against a fake `sb` (approved, `pending_review`, missing row, DB error, admin exception). t2 adds fake-sb coverage that a `pending_review` driver is skipped on preferred assign, offer preview, and driving carpool create, while an approved driver is not. `packages/rides-native/drivers.test.js` covers the online list and open-pool desk the same way.


### Approved drivers skip applicant steps

An application with `onboarding_status = approved` is sufficient for the existing
online, offer, and accept gates. Missing documents, a missing W-9, or an older
IC agreement must not turn an approved driver back into an applicant. Online
presence alone does not grant approval to an applicant.

Web onboarding reads approval first and shows its approved screen without loading
compliance records. Native onboarding reads approval first and returns approved
drivers to driver home. Native home and queue retain their last confirmed state
when a refresh fails; a successful read of a changed status still takes effect.
Both direct submission fallbacks return success for approved drivers without
reading compliance records or writing application status. API and direct review
updates exclude approved rows, including approval concurrent with submission.
Applicant document, W-9, agreement, and admin-approval checks remain in place.

Verification (use test accounts; do not send application-notification emails):

- With an approved application and missing compliance records or an old agreement,
  open web driver home and native driver home, then open an onboarding deep link.
  Web shows approval; native returns home without applicant steps or re-signing.
- Go online, receive an offer, and accept a test ride. Approval alone satisfies the
  onboarding gate; existing trip/payment eligibility rules still apply.
- Fail a native application refresh after approval was loaded: home/queue retain
  the last confirmed approval and show the read error rather than applicant copy.
- With a pending applicant, verify incomplete submission is rejected and online,
  offers, and acceptance remain gated. Complete onboarding before admin approval.
- Unit tests simulate an unavailable API and an approval concurrent with direct
  submission; both must preserve `approved` and never write it to `pending_review`.

No database migration is required for this change.
